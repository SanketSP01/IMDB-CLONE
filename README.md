# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


-For Installation : First Clone or Download the Project from Github.
                    Then open the project in the VS Code.
                    Open the Terminal in the VS code.
                    Type npm install. // It will Download all the Dependency for the Project.
                    Then in the terminal write npm run dev.
                    It will start the Project on localhost.
